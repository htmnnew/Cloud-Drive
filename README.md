# Cloud-Drive
 A cloud storage system written in Java and HTML

This was a Team project for a web development course. The program was initialy deployed on the univercity server which unfortunately I do not have access to after graduating. However it can be deployed to any other server with a few changes.

the Login and Passwords are not encrypted as they are only there to test seperate users' storage systems not colliding. You can just click to register as a new user to login. 

The program uses Servlets, Sessions, Bootstrap, Java Beans, JSP, and SQL.
To connect to a new server you need to change the strings 'username' and 'password' in the code with your server credentals. Also make sure to putthe correct server url in the code.
